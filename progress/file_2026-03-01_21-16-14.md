# DRF Migration and Descriptive Backend Signatures

## Changes made (Concise)
- Migrated backend API implementation from raw Django function views to Django REST Framework (`@api_view`, `Request`, `Response`, `status`).
- Added `rest_framework` to Django settings and configured JSON-only renderer/parser defaults.
- Added typed DRF serializers in `backend/core/serializers.py` for request/response validation and payload shaping.
- Refactored `backend/core/views.py` to use serializer validation, DRF responses, and explicit endpoint docstrings.
- Improved backend service readability by adding descriptive function docstrings and clearer helper signatures in `backend/core/services.py`.
- Added dependency lock file `backend/requirements.txt` with Django + DRF versions.
- Updated backend run instructions to install requirements before running.

## Why - Reason (Descriptive)
Using DRF standardizes API behavior (validation, error handling, typed payload contracts), which makes the backend easier to maintain and safer to evolve as clients grow. Adding descriptive signatures/docstrings clarifies intent and expected behavior for each function, reducing onboarding time and implementation ambiguity for future contributors and agents.

## When can this be replicated
- When a Django backend starts as minimal JSON views and needs stronger API contracts.
- When endpoints require structured request validation and consistent response shaping.
- When codebase readability and maintainability need improvement through explicit function descriptions and typed signatures.
