# Frontend Modularization Update

## Changes made (Concise)
- Split `frontend/src/app/page.tsx` into a lightweight page entry that renders a reusable `SpiritUI` component.
- Added `frontend/src/components/spirit/SpiritUI.tsx` and extracted page sections into composable units (`Sidebar`, `TopBar`, `SearchSection`, `WorkspaceHeader`, `WorkspaceCard`).
- Added reusable UI primitives in `frontend/src/components/spirit/controls.tsx` (`IconButton`, `NavButton`, `FilterPill`) to reduce repeated button/nav markup.
- Added typed UI config data in `frontend/src/data/spirit.ts` for nav items, filters, and cards.
- Validated changes with `npm run lint` in `frontend`.

## Why - Reason (Descriptive)
The previous implementation had one large component with repeated class blocks and duplicated UI patterns, which made future updates error-prone. This refactor separates concerns by moving structure, primitives, and data into clear modules. It improves maintainability, enables reuse of common controls, and makes UI expansion mostly data-driven rather than copy/paste-driven.

## When can this be replicated
- When a page grows into one large JSX file with duplicated visual patterns.
- When multiple sections share nearly identical button/card/nav structures.
- When future feature growth is expected and adding items should be done via data arrays rather than direct JSX duplication.
