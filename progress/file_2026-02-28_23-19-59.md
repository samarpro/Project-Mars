# Django Project Bootstrap

## Changes made (Concise)
- Created backend virtual environment at `backend/.venv` using Homebrew Python.
- Installed Django and dependencies in the virtual environment.
- Scaffolded Django project in `backend` with package name `project_mars`.
- Ran initial migrations to create `db.sqlite3`.
- Added command-by-command setup documentation at `backend/SETUP_COMMANDS.md`.

## Why - Reason (Descriptive)
The backend directory was empty, so a baseline Django project was required to begin backend development. Using a local virtual environment keeps dependencies isolated from system/global Python packages. The command log ensures the setup is reproducible and transparent for future onboarding and automation.

## When can this be replicated
- When initializing a new Django backend in an empty directory.
- When standardizing backend environment setup across team members.
- When you need reproducible setup documentation for local development and CI scripting.
