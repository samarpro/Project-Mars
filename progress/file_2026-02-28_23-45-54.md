# PRD and Agent Knowledge Documentation

## Changes made (Concise)
- Added `docs/PRD.md` with a full execution-focused product requirements document for Project Mars.
- Added `docs/AGENT_KNOWLEDGE.md` with foundational project knowledge and operational guardrails for agents.
- Captured MVP scope, functional/non-functional requirements, interfaces, metrics, acceptance criteria, and testing scenarios.

## Why - Reason (Descriptive)
The project needed a decision-complete product document that engineering and product can directly execute against, plus a compact knowledge base to align future agent behavior with product intent and constraints. This reduces ambiguity, prevents scope drift, and ensures core mode behavior (Journal vs Learning) is preserved across implementations.

## When can this be replicated
- When a product definition exists but implementation teams need actionable requirements.
- When onboarding new engineers/agents requires consistent terminology and guardrails.
- When transitioning from concept statements to delivery-ready documentation.
