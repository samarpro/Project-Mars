# Full MVP Wiring: Backend + Frontend

## Changes made (Concise)
- Built Django `core` app with product entities: Space, Document, Block, WritingSession, Insight, InsightEvent, SentimentSnapshot, StreakState.
- Implemented API endpoints for bootstrap, spaces, documents, sessions, block syncing, insight retrieval, and insight events.
- Added lightweight insight engine with mode-aware classification and block segmentation.
- Added Journal finalize behavior (delayed insight generation), Learning in-flow behavior, streak updates, and sentiment snapshots.
- Added local CORS middleware and wired API routes into project URLs.
- Replaced static frontend page with an interactive writing workspace connected to backend APIs.
- Added frontend API client and environment variable support (`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE`).
- Added backend integration tests covering Learning and Journal mode flows.

## Why - Reason (Descriptive)
The project previously had disconnected pieces: a scaffolded backend with no domain logic and a static frontend UI. The implementation delivers a runnable end-to-end MVP aligned with Project Mars behavior, including mode-specific insight timing and cross-reference workflows. This enables realistic product iteration and engineering validation from a working baseline.

## When can this be replicated
- When converting a product document into a first functional full-stack MVP.
- When needing mode-aware retrieval behavior with simple explainable heuristics before advanced ranking models.
- When setting up a local-first stack that requires frontend-backend integration, analytics events, and testable workflows.
