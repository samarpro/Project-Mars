## Product Definition

**Working Name:** Project Mars

### What is it?

A cross-referencing writing environment that connects what you are writing *right now* to what you have written *before* — surfacing hidden relationships, forgotten context, and evolved thinking from your personal library of notes, journals, and learning material.

It is a note-taking app at its surface. But its core is an active intelligence layer that sits beneath your writing and treats your accumulated text as a living, queryable knowledge base — not dead storage.

---

### The Core Problem it Solves

People who write consistently — students, professionals, lifelong learners — accumulate a large body of written thought over time. Journals, notes, ideas, reflections, lessons learned. But that library becomes inert. It doesn't talk back. You can't see how your thinking has evolved. You repeat the same mistakes you already documented. You relearn things you already understood. You solve problems from ground zero that your past self already worked through. You build new ideas in isolation from old ones you invested time in.

The writing exists. The insight is trapped inside it.

### What the Product Does

As you write, the system cross-references your current text against your entire personal library at the block level — meaning individual paragraphs or passages, not just whole documents. It identifies relationships between what you are writing now and what you have written before, and surfaces them to you in a way that is relevant to *why* you are writing.

The type of relationship it looks for, and *when* it surfaces it, adapts based on the writing mode you are in.

### Writing Modes

The system supports two explicit modes, chosen by the user before writing:

**Journal Mode** You write freely and without interruption. The system holds back while you write. After you are done, it surfaces contradictions ("you felt the opposite about this six months ago"), similar reflections ("you worked through this exact problem before, here's what you wrote"), and emotional patterns over time. It also tracks sentiment across your journal entries and maintains a streak to reflect the quality and consistency of your journaling habit. The delayed surfacing is intentional — journaling should not be interrupted.

**Learning Mode** The system is more active while you write. As you take notes on something new, it surfaces connections to things you have already learned — finding conceptual overlaps, building bridges between new and prior knowledge. The goal is to accelerate understanding by anchoring new ideas to an existing mental model. "This is similar to what you learned here. If you understood that, here's what connects them."

---

### The "Aha" Moment

For a journal user: you are writing about a problem you are facing, feeling like you are starting from scratch. The system surfaces a note from two years ago where you faced the same problem, worked through it, and documented what helped. You didn't remember writing it. That note becomes advice from your past self.

For a learning user: you are studying a new concept and struggling to place it. The system tells you it maps closely to something you already understand and shows you the connection. The new concept clicks faster because it is anchored to something you already own.

---

### The Library

Your library is everything you have written inside the app, plus content imported from external platforms — Notion, Google Docs, PDFs, and others. By default the entire library is available for cross-referencing. Users can curate subsets if they want. The system organises content into collections or spaces, so a student can keep physics notes separate from personal journals, and cross-referencing respects those boundaries.

---

### Future Dimensions

The product is architected to expand without being blocked by any single market. The same core engine — block-level cross-referencing across a personal or shared library — applies to:

A student accelerating their learning by connecting new knowledge to prior notes. A professional reflecting on how their thinking and decisions have evolved. A team onboarding a new employee by cross-referencing their writing against the organisation's existing knowledge base. A researcher finding unexpected thematic or conceptual links across a large body of work.

The immediate target user is anyone who writes frequently and has accumulated significant written material — and who suspects there is more value in what they have already written than they are currently able to access.

### What it is Not

It is not a search engine. You do not query it — it comes to you. It is not a memory aid in the traditional sense — it does not flash cards or test you. It is not trying to replace your thinking — it is trying to make your past thinking available to your present thinking, at the moment it is most relevant.```
